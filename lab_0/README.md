# Lab 0: Environment Set Up

## Intro

In order to get the most smooth introduction in software engineering, it’s highly recommended to use a UNIX-like operating system. This laboratory work will help you get a comfortable basic setup & knowledge for implementing the following laboratory works.

## Tasks

Laboratory work consists of a few small steps to get your environment ready. Having these tasks done, you will be ready for Lab 1.

1. **Install a UNIX-based operating system.** The easiest way would be to install as dual boot one of the popular Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, maybe Arch if you suffer from insomnia. \
**Note**: Skip this step if you already use a Linux distribution or MacOS.

2. **Install essential tools.** You should install the “starting pack” of a software engineer on your machine. This includes zsh, oh-my-zsh, Git, gcc compiler, your favorite ide/editor.

3. **Create a Git repository.** Write a small hello-world program in C. Compile it using GCC and Make. Commit your changes and push them to your remote repository.

**Good Luck!**
