# Lab 2: Into OOP and Encapsulation

## Intro

Hello, here we meet again. Implementing `Lab 1` you definitely had thoughts that the code of data structures and their operations could be organized in a more structured way. So, here we'll introduce the concept of *Object Oriented Programming* and its principles.

This laboratory work is the first one in a series of 4 labs (`Lab 2`, `Lab 3`, `Lab 4`, `Lab 5`). All of them will represent one project that you'll improve step-by-step.

## The Simulation

![matrix: simulation](img/simulation.jpg)

A better way to reveal all the charms of OOP will be a simulation of a system a real world system, a game or any other autonomous entropic system that will "live" by some rules written by you. It can be a simulation of a taxi company, a bank, a restaurant or maybe a game like chess or even Counter-Strike or Tower Defense. Also, you can choose some nonexistent system, but you'll have to develop clear rules of how it's working by yourself.
**Important:** no UI is needed. All you need is to provide a clear way in text to show what's happening inside your system.

## Encapsulation

In first laboratory in this series you'll have to choose the system you want to simulate. Then, you'll try the role of an architect. You need to design the objects/entities/participants/actors of your simulation. Focus on finding the entities and defining them from the perspective of their internal logic. Make sure that your simulation won't be too primitive, so you need to have **at least 10 entities** in it.

So, based your simulation and it's rules, you have to define the list of required objects for you system to work and their internal logic.
**For the presentation you have to instantiate the defined classes and show that they do something.**

Let's recap:
* No UI needed, just text-based way to show what's happening inside the simulation
* No interaction between objects is needed yet, just their internal logic
* Don't choose too primitive simulation

## Allowed Tools

For this project you're allowed to use programming languages as:
* C++
* Java
* Kotlin
* C#
* Ruby

If you want to use something else, let's discuss it first.

## Grading

This laboratory work will be graded based on:
1. The complexity of your simulation (*at lest 10 objects*).
1. Architecture of the system.
1. The internal logic of your objects.
1. Code styling.

## General Requirements

* Working in a Unix-based operating system.
* All operations (files and directories creating, compiling source code, creating git repository and committing changes and etc.) should be done **using command line exclusively**.
* Work should be done by yourself. **Plagiarism is penalized.**

## Deadline

**Time to complete:** _**1 week**_ since you receive the requirements \
_Each week_ of lateness will cost you minus _**1 point**_.

You can present just **one laboratory work per day**, so don't try to present all of them at the end. \
To be **admitted to midterm, you have to present all laboratories received before it**, so, again, don't procrastinate and ideally present one lab per week.

## Presentation

Write a `README` file where you describe how you chose what you want to simulate, what objects you defined and what logic they implement.
Upload your code to a remote repository and send the link to it to <alexandr.calugari@isa.utm.md> with subject including 'OOP Lab 2', **before the deadline**.
The presentations themselves will be offline at laboratory classes.

**Good Luck!**
